# UE C++ Init

A simple, zero-dependency CLI tool to quickly initialize a C++ project structure for any Unreal Engine Blueprint-only project.

(Only Support to create UE5.6 C++ Project)

## Why?

When you want to convert a Blueprint-only Unreal Engine project to a C++ project, you need to manually create the `Source` directory and a set of boilerplate files (`.Build.cs`, `.Target.cs`). This tool automates that process.

## Installation

Install it globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g ue-cpp-init
